# Title

# Abstract
In recent years, meat consumption has received a lot of attention as a result of global warming. Meat production is said to be one of the largest contributors to global warming as the production of meat requires a lot of resources, such as huge amounts of water and land-area. Especially red meat has received a reputation for being a large contributor to climate change, and it would be interesting to see if there is data to support this claim. We suspect that the meat-industry has affected the production of crops, which we assume has lower greenhouse emissions compared to meat. In this project we want to understand and study how production of crops and livestock have changed globally since the 1960s, as well as looking at the consequences of this. Datasets from fao.org, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, will be used.


# Research questions
How has the crops/livestock primary production developed since 1960?
Is there a connection between the development of livestock primary production and crop production?
How are the differences in production quantities between the different continents?
How has the development in agriculture affected emission of greenhouse gasses?

We have decided to compliment FAOs Global Food and Agriculture dataset with another dataset from FAO containing data on livestock primary production. This is due to the fact that the Global Food and Agriculture dataset does not contain any information regarding livestock and we want to be able to study the relationship between how crops and livestock production have developed over the last half decade. The online datasets are extremely big and comprehensive, but luckily easy to use thanks to them being well structured and easy to understand. We are able to exactly choose which data to download, but it will be a challenge to choose the most valuable and interesting data.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
1 - Data Wrangling and Exploration (Deadline 4th November)
- Decide on the most important indicators/features in the datasets and download
- Look at the dataset and get a feel of the data (distributions etc)
- Be as certain as possible that if we have enough and correct data to move on
2 - Data Cleaning (Deadline 11th November)
- Remove errors, or unimportant information
- Decide on important groupings 
3. Data Analysis and Visualization (Deadline 18th November)
- Find key statistical indicators 
- Visualize the results
4. Finalize notebook (Deadline 25th November)
- Make sure that the analysis is well documented and motivated
- Make sure that the visualization choices are optimal and easy to understand


# Questions for TAa
1. Is this a resonable scope of the project?
