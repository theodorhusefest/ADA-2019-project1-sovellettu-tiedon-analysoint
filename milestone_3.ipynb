    "\n",
    "Food production has increased in all continents from 1961 to 2013 and today we are poducing more food per person than we did in 1961. We can also see that the way that the production has developped follows a general pattern, that is, the population growth in each respective continent. This makes sense as an increased population will require more food production in order to be able to feed all habitants. This also lead to the fact that every crop and meat category has increased production wise since 1961. No category has decreased in popularity on world level. However, when looking at the different continents it is possible to see decrease in popularity for some products. For example Europe has had a decrease in roots & tubers production but Africa has had a big increase in production of roots & tubers. Therefore, on a world level, roots & tubers production has increased but it is no longer as popular in Europe. As mentioned, most categories have increased in production, however the smallest crops/meats categories have held a quite consistent production quantity over the years (visible in the box plots). These categories are 'crops, other', 'meat, other' and 'meat, equidae & camelidae'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three most produced meat categories are pig, chicken and cattle with pig being the largest one. In fourth place, we have bovidae, since it is big in Oceania (sheep) and Africa (goat & buffalo). All continents but North America and Oceania have a larger increase in meat producation than both crops production and population growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest crops production category is cereals which is not not surprising as this includes rice and wheat. Second and third place are coarse grain and roots & tubers."
